Project Drasil

Free fan-made manual/tabletop simulation of the [Digimon Card Game](https://world.digimoncard.com/).

It is still in development but has every feature needed to play smoothly.
Keep in mind the game page is not optimized for mobile devices yet.
Thx to [@allesandrostagni](https://github.com/alessandrostagni) we also provide a mostly automated bot to play against.

Check the [Featues & Controls](https://github.com/WE-Kaito/digimon-tcg-simulator/wiki) page for futher information.

Feel free to use the code to improve upon. Reviews, bug-reports and feature-requests are also very welcome!
