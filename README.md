Project Drasil
---

This started as a graduation project for a full stack coding bootcamp.
It was always a dream of mine to make some sort of Digimon fan game, so why not making the still missing sim for [its card game](https://world.digimoncard.com/)?

Feel free to use the code to improve upon. Reviews, bug-reports and feature-requests are also very welcome!

**Features**:
- [x] Register with a unique username + password to use the App.
- [X] Password Recovery with a safety question + answer.
- [x] Deckbuilder using data provided by [digimoncard.app](https://digimoncard.app/).
- [X] Import / Export your deck list. (Currently TTS format only)
- [x] Drag and drop cards and card-stacks.
- [x] Edit your decks and set your avatar, card sleeve and active deck on the profile page.
- [x] Chat with other players and invite your friends in the Lobby.
- [x] Mobile compatible (Game page currently not too optimized).
- [X] Manual simulation of the *Digimon Card Game* with audio and animations and a Log
